May 11 10:56:34 <n0yser|phone>	Looks like that irc shat itself for a moment 
May 11 10:56:49 <n0yser|phone>	Dug pls explain the password thingy you mentioned earlier 
May 11 10:57:00 <dug>	Yea I’ve been fudgin with the server
May 11 10:57:36 <dug>	I was just saying if you wanted to login, I could just use my powers to change your password in the database, since you can’t get emails right now to reset it
May 11 10:57:56 <dug>	I could make the password anything you want, but I couldn’t change it back
May 11 10:58:09 <dug>	But if you want to wait for your charger or whatever that’s fine too
May 11 10:58:54 <n0yser|phone>	Hmmm weird I didn't get a mail. I checked multiple time if I typed it correctly 
May 11 10:59:22 <dug>	no you typed it fine
May 11 10:59:34 <dug>	For some reason proton is flagging my mail as spam so I reached out to them to fix it
May 11 10:59:48 <n0yser|phone>	Oh
May 11 10:59:50 <n0yser|phone>	Hmmm
May 11 11:00:14 <n0yser|phone>	Well in that case I might just wait for my charger to arrive 
May 11 11:00:22 <dug>	Yea no worries
May 11 11:00:57 <n0yser|phone>	I don't mind you giving me password but I wanna keep it super secure. I used a fancy password generator for it

May 11 19:46:57 <dug>	I keep settling on meme faces
May 11 19:57:04 <Kud>	I kinda had the same struggle of figuring out an emote for a negative emotion.
May 11 19:57:30 <Kud>	Maybe an angry punk? A melancholic violin player?
May 11 20:00:39 <Kud>	I wonder..

May 11 10:57:00 <dug>	Yea I’ve been fudgin with the server
May 11 10:57:36 <dug>	I was just saying if you wanted to login, I could just use my powers to change your password in the database, since you can’t get emails right now to reset it
May 11 10:57:56 <dug>	I could make the password anything you want, but I couldn’t change it back
May 11 10:58:09 <dug>	But if you want to wait for your charger or whatever that’s fine too
May 11 10:58:54 <n0yser|phone>	Hmmm weird I didn't get a mail. I checked multiple time if I typed it correctly 
May 11 10:59:22 <dug>	no you typed it fine
May 11 10:59:34 <dug>	For some reason proton is flagging my mail as spam so I reached out to them to fix it

May 11 11:00:57 <n0yser|phone>	I don't mind you giving me password but I wanna keep it super secure. I used a fancy password generator for it

May 11 19:46:48 <dug>	I was trying to think of what to use as a sad emote… or emotes in general
May 11 19:46:57 <dug>	I keep settling on meme faces
May 11 19:57:04 <Kud>	I kinda had the same struggle of figuring out an emote for a negative emotion.
May 11 19:57:30 <Kud>	Maybe an angry punk? A melancholic violin player?
May 11 20:00:39 <Kud>	I wonder..
May 11 20:23:19 <kona>	yes, hello

Jul 06 19:32:56 <dug_>	cracker barrel feels more like a family dining room (1800s) than a lounge where you meet people
