Jun 28 11:23:41 <dug>	a spectrum of forest green to lime green sludge

Jun 28 11:27:47 <sneaky_dice>	Howdy
Jun 28 11:28:18 <Punp>	TL;DR Sam (the main character) has got a promotion at work but he doesn't like it. A man named Buttle was arrested instead of a man named Tuttle. Sam's central heating has started playing up
Jun 28 11:28:33 <sneaky_dice>	thanks
Jun 28 11:28:50 <Punp>	No sweat. It's basically 1984 as told by Terry Gilliam

Jun 28 11:30:29 <b4rkod_>	guro for machines
Jun 28 11:31:19 <Punp>	It's the whole vibe. It's a message about being swallowed by the machine of the city

Jun 28 11:32:48 <Punp>	you'll also recognise the heating engineer
Jun 28 11:32:54 <b4rkod_>	does the very long cap flap have canonical significance?
Jun 28 11:33:15 <Punp>	Robert De Niro
Jun 28 11:33:30 <Punp>	Yeah, it's just a note about ridiculous uniforms Lilly
Jun 28 11:34:08 <Punp>	The musical motif that keeps repeating was apparently a track that was heard on a holiday beach by Gilliam
Jun 28 11:34:15 <b4rkod_>	i like their silly hats
Jun 28 11:34:18 <Punp>	I think my friend found the original vinyl rip for it
Jun 28 11:34:21 <Punp>	Yeah me too

Jun 28 11:57:05 <Punp>	I wonder how they made it
Jun 28 11:57:11 <Punp>	I don't think it's actual armour
Jun 28 11:57:21 <Punp>	Likely beaten tin

Jun 28 11:57:41 <Punp>	Well, not that size, but yeah
Jun 28 11:57:59 <b4rkod_>	i think that would be worse than not having armor at all
Jun 28 11:58:07 <Punp>	This is how Spheral wishes he could dress
Jun 28 11:58:25 <Punp>	Considering it's mostly pike work and horse riding I'm sure they're fine b4rkod

Jun 28 12:07:53 <Punp>	Strangely, no, dug
Jun 28 12:10:08 <Punp>	There has to be a name for the genre of narrative where people are whisked through an array of different types of people
Jun 28 12:10:16 <Punp>	Like Alice in Wonderland
Jun 28 12:10:27 <Punp>	Each of them are representatives of their phase of "hell"

Jun 28 13:01:09 <Punp>	Have you noticed that it's been Christmas this whole film?
Jun 28 13:01:18 <sneaky_dice>	bonking in his mother's bed too
Jun 28 13:01:18 <b4rkod_>	he ruined her life, the guy that got wrongfully murdered is still dead, his wife and child are still in misery
Jun 28 13:02:02 <Punp>	This is a very Gilliam misery film
Jun 28 13:02:24 <Punp>	These are what my paranoid nightmares look like
Jun 28 13:03:07 <Punp>	This is basically what happens at the end of 1984
Jun 28 13:04:50 <b4rkod_>	1984 was far worse in every way
Jun 28 13:05:50 <Punp>	If you mean that section in the middle where the author dropped his notes for three chapters, I agree
Jun 28 13:10:44 <b4rkod_>	 i don't remember inconsistencies in 1984
Jun 28 13:11:16 <Punp>	woah what if it was intentional
Jun 28 13:11:25 *	Mew has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
Jun 28 13:11:34 <b4rkod_>	but tbh you probably read it in a more media literate way than me, i am barely media literate
Jun 28 13:12:46 <Punp>	I guess that comes with only having seen ten movies outside of movie night, yeah
Jun 28 13:13:00 <b4rkod_>	i read books
Jun 28 13:14:17 <Punp>	The two mediums are very similar
Jun 28 13:14:27 <Punp>	This is a real place
Jun 28 13:14:28 <Punp>	in the UK
Jun 28 13:14:33 <Punp>	It gets very windy apparently
Jun 28 13:15:00 <b4rkod_>	1984 was built on actual ww2 UK anyways
Jun 28 13:17:10 <sneaky_dice>	lotta tubes in this movie
Jun 28 13:17:30 <Punp>	Yeah, it's the duct aesthetic, it's their thing

Jul 05 11:16:36 <Punp>	You've not missed anything
Jul 05 11:16:47 <Punp>	TL;DR the new recruits are anti-establishmentarians
Jul 05 11:17:07 <Punp>	and they're gonna witness the horrors of war
Jul 05 11:17:27 <dug>	and they have a korean servant boy they're teaching to do stuff
Jul 05 11:18:15 <b4rkod_>	the boy is very bad vibes not gonna lie
Jul 05 11:18:57 <b4rkod_>	not the boy himself but how they use him
Jul 05 11:18:59 <No56>	somehow i doubt the army had this many hippies and beatniks in it back in the 50s
Jul 05 11:19:56 <b4rkod_>	1950's are haydays of pro war nationalism, especially for America. 
Jul 05 11:21:24 <eris>	nice kpop
Jul 05 11:22:31 <Punp>	omg it's this guy!!!
Jul 05 11:23:02 <Punp>	Donald Sutherland

Jul 05 11:23:08 <b4rkod_>	i hate this hippy guy, my hopes are shattered
Jul 05 11:23:46 <No56>	i think he got ended up getting typecast as an anti-establishement military guy
Jul 05 11:23:50 <Punp>	What a time to be eating chicken
Jul 05 11:24:24 <b4rkod_>	this is read meat punp, nothing like your white meat
Jul 05 11:24:36 <eris>	humans are white meat actually
Jul 05 11:24:39 <eris>	we're like pork
Jul 05 11:25:02 <No56>	i dont like this audio mixing, too gimmicky
Jul 05 11:25:09 <b4rkod_>	thats a very interesting thing to say
Jul 05 11:25:24 <eris>	what

Jul 05 11:26:49 <No56>	i guess?
Jul 05 11:26:52 <b4rkod_>	military is gay as shit
Jul 05 11:26:58 <Punp>	neat
Jul 05 11:26:58 <eris>	human meat is often referred to as long pig

Jul 05 11:27:34 <b4rkod_>	oh i love that
Jul 05 11:27:41 <Punp>	Long pork? All the time
Jul 05 11:27:45 <eris>	https://gizmodo.com/what-kind-of-meat-is-human-meat-1511534805
Jul 05 11:27:50 <Punp>	I thought this was a comedy. Is it not?
Jul 05 11:28:13 <b4rkod_>	by that, i mean the helicopter
Jul 05 11:28:37 <eris>	Punp i don't know tbh
Jul 05 11:28:58 <eris>	might be the tv show that
Jul 05 11:29:03 <eris>	is lighthearted
Jul 05 11:29:36 <Punp>	Ah right, I just thought I didn't get it
Jul 05 11:29:43 <b4rkod_>	that engine was a conventional piston engine i think, but there are helicopter engines that use the torque created by the crankshaft to turn the wings and they are the coolest things ever
Jul 05 11:29:44 <Punp>	This seems like it'll be a slow burning full metal jacket
Jul 05 11:30:01 <Punp>	You're a special sort of interesting, Lilly
Jul 05 11:30:24 <b4rkod_>	i would rather you just say a slur ngl

Jul 05 11:32:16 <b4rkod_>	last time i did that you flamed me for killing the movie night
Jul 05 11:32:28 <b4rkod_>	but it runs now
Jul 05 11:32:44 <eris>	i must say this hasn't grabbed me so far
Jul 05 11:32:45 <No56>	is the message here that nobody gives a shit about the war
Jul 05 11:32:54 <eris>	yeah me either
Jul 05 11:33:22 <eris>	oh, hi odo

Jul 05 11:33:38 <Punp>	yeesh
Jul 05 11:34:08 <b4rkod_>	is this propaganda about how war isn't that bad for rebels?
Jul 05 11:34:11 <Punp>	Yeah I'm not big into this, it's trying to go "fly on the wall" but I don't care about any of these people or their boring shit
Jul 05 11:34:35 <b4rkod_>	the mixing ruins it, how can a professional movies mixing be this bad
Jul 05 11:34:47 <eris>	can we just carpetbomb this encampment
Jul 05 11:34:51 <Punp>	We're seeing the incidental fallout for war, and they'll do a "big hit" with the horrors of war with a bloody montage later
Jul 05 11:35:18 <No56>	war is le bad, i don't want to be here, therefore it's okay for me not to give a shit about anything
Jul 05 11:35:26 <Punp>	Don't worry frens, it'll be Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction after this
Jul 05 11:35:27 <No56>	very boomerish attitude tbh
Jul 05 11:35:42 <Punp>	This is a gen x vibe but I get what you're saying
Jul 05 11:35:56 <b4rkod_>	i don't even get when that hipster started sleeping with the leitunant, mixing is soo bad i didn't realise they were having a connection
Jul 05 11:36:02 <No56>	given the release date i want to say boomer
Jul 05 11:36:19 <Punp>	It's very vietnam war energy
Jul 05 11:36:30 <No56>	extremely

Jul 05 11:37:09 <eris>	like i actually don't understand
Jul 05 11:37:10 <dug>	it'll drive you back to the theatre to listen to the other dialogue
Jul 05 11:37:29 <b4rkod_>	i thought my headphone being bad ruined it for me but you all do too?
Jul 05 11:37:32 <eris>	i thought that was 'hail to the chief, he's the best of all the trannies'
Jul 05 11:37:51 <b4rkod_>	the voice and video are 2 entirely different things
Jul 05 11:37:52 <eris>	time to transvestigate truman
Jul 05 11:37:54 <No56>	my grandpa who was actually in korea hated the MASH tv show, now i can kind of see why
Jul 05 11:39:29 <Punp>	Ohhh it's Ross and Monica's dad, not the grandfather from Goldbergs
Jul 05 11:39:30 <eris>	irrelevant to the movie but my friend just sent me this and i burst out laughing

Jul 05 12:05:35 <Punp>	uhmm are you forgetting the bit where they had the last supper?
Jul 05 12:05:48 <Punp>	size really do be everything back in the 70s
Jul 05 12:05:53 <Punp>	that's got to be a meme
Jul 05 12:06:24 <dug>	dis mf talking about the subtle nuance of mr. bean
Jul 05 12:06:26 <b4rkod_>	this is the first time i felt offended about a homophobic joke
Jul 05 12:06:44 <No56>	the fact that inability to screw around and sleep with random women is being equated with death, suicide, suffering in war speaks volumes about boomer psychology
Jul 05 12:07:18 <eris>	i'm enjoying this so little that i'm doing other stuff
Jul 05 12:07:45 <Punp>	Yeah me too, this is weak
Jul 05 12:07:47 <No56>	donald sutherland is still cool tho
Jul 05 12:07:56 <b4rkod_>	you should also kill yourself if you are gay apperantly
Jul 05 12:07:58 <No56>	the actor, not this particular character
Jul 05 12:08:19 <Punp>	Donald Sutherland is always a class act
Jul 05 12:08:52 <Punp>	Main message is "I'm not wrong and I don't have to change, you're just too easily offended, hotlips"
Jul 05 12:12:07 <Punp>	Just when you thought it couldn't get more boomerhumour rapey
Jul 05 12:12:30 *	vitnira (vitnira@146.70.183.149) has joined

Jul 05 12:13:16 <b4rkod_>	you think it can't get any worse
Jul 05 12:13:23 <Punp>	It'll get worse
Jul 05 12:13:30 <No56>	meanwhile some evac pilot carrying a guy bleeding to death is wondering where all the surgeons are
Jul 05 12:13:37 <Punp>	haha
Jul 05 12:13:59 <Punp>	"haha she's crying what a stuck up bitch"
Jul 05 12:14:28 <Punp>	"haha he dismissed her legitimate concerns haha"
Jul 05 12:15:09 <b4rkod_>	this is the least funny thing we watched, right
Jul 05 12:15:25 <b4rkod_>	even in that coco bird movie i was late for, there was some funny
Jul 05 12:16:07 <eris>	this is by far the worst movie of all movie night so far
Jul 05 12:16:10 <eris>	and i apologize deeply
Jul 05 12:16:41 <No56>	i dont regret watching it because now i have more ammunition in the struggle against boomerism
Jul 05 12:17:21 <Punp>	No worries eris, glad I watched it to know it fucking sucks
Jul 05 12:17:28 <vitnira>	oh is it over

Jul 05 12:17:45 <b4rkod_>	not yet we still have to suffer throught more
Jul 05 12:17:49 <Punp>	I swear if it just ends after all this I'm gonna be so :|
Jul 05 12:18:38 <b4rkod_>	sexism, homophobia, racism, anti-disabled rhetoric, hipster bullshit, it has it all
Jul 05 12:19:08 <dug>	mind you, the society that made this movie only just gave black people the right to vote and share movie theatres
Jul 05 12:20:23 <b4rkod_>	when was this movie made?
Jul 05 12:20:27 <dug>	1970
Jul 05 12:20:28 <No56>	i'm glad they're playing this music so we know they're in japan

Jul 05 12:20:47 <Punp>	MARGE GET THE CAMERA
Jul 05 12:20:57 <Punp>	MARGE THEY DID THE GONG
Jul 05 12:21:09 <No56>	im going to say this, if the us army was like this in vietnam i'm glad the viet cong won
Jul 05 12:21:40 <b4rkod_>	american army was 10 times worse in Vietnam
Jul 05 12:22:06 <b4rkod_>	they didn't commit organised rape against their allied forced even once
Jul 05 12:22:41 <Punp>	Yet
Jul 05 12:23:17 <b4rkod_>	how much more do we have to suffer
Jul 05 12:23:44 <eris>	i'll check the playout
Jul 05 12:24:02 <eris>	33min D:

Jul 05 12:24:19 <eris>	Punp my rating is -20
Jul 05 12:24:28 <b4rkod_>	they will rape a women for sure in those 30 minutes
Jul 05 12:24:43 <Punp>	It only goes from 0 to 5, but I also vote -20
Jul 05 12:25:46 <b4rkod_>	-5 easily
Jul 05 12:26:29 <Punp>	What the fuck are they being court marshalled for
Jul 05 12:26:39 <eris>	why are they in fucking japan
Jul 05 12:26:43 <eris>	i thought it was koreeerrrr
Jul 05 12:26:49 <b4rkod_>	they are le based anti establishment american man
Jul 05 12:26:52 <Punp>	It was and they got flown out for reasons
Jul 05 12:27:11 <No56>	ikee ma shoe lmao
Jul 05 12:27:12 <Punp>	They're smarter than everyone there
Jul 05 12:27:13 <b4rkod_>	Japan is a american military base, i think shit like that would happen irl too
Jul 05 12:27:20 <Punp>	Good time to go and get a drink
Jul 05 12:27:45 <b4rkod_>	i was waiting for that 'asian man small penis' joke
Jul 05 12:28:26 <Punp>	Jesus fucking Christ
Jul 05 12:29:14 <No56>	i hate this movie so much
Jul 05 12:29:19 <b4rkod_>	the only cool thing about this movie is helicopter
Jul 05 12:29:41 <dug>	my favorite part is the comm announcements
Jul 05 12:29:42 <b4rkod_>	did you see the 'MASH' text on the car
Jul 05 12:29:53 <eris>	the only cool thing about this movie is the fact it's gonna be ending soon
Jul 05 12:30:06 <b4rkod_>	20 more minutes, thats many minutes
Jul 05 12:30:15 <Punp>	God give me strength
Jul 05 12:30:39 <dug>	why not skip it? is the stream pre-configured?
Jul 05 12:30:51 <b4rkod_>	we watch this shit religiously dug
Jul 05 12:31:00 <b4rkod_>	the show MUST go on, no matter how much we hate it
Jul 05 12:31:04 <eris>	yeah it's preconfigured
Jul 05 12:31:13 <eris>	if i fuck with it i have to kick everyone out
Jul 05 12:31:27 <Punp>	That might be a blessing
Jul 05 12:31:27 <b4rkod_>	eris, do it

Jul 05 12:32:51 <Punp>	What if something happens
Jul 05 12:33:16 <b4rkod_>	the best that could happen is 10 more minutes of rape jokes
Jul 05 12:33:26 <b4rkod_>	here is it coming
Jul 05 12:33:29 <dug>	nothing has happened for an hour and a half
Jul 05 12:33:31 <vitnira>	what are you guys watching lmao
Jul 05 12:33:33 <No56>	the whole "not my problem" attitude on display in this film is ironically the same kind of mindset that motivated unprovoked napalm strikes on random villages in vietnam
Jul 05 12:33:38 <eris>	nothing happens
Jul 05 12:33:41 <b4rkod_>	he will see her and see something like 'i get why you guys would do that'
Jul 05 12:33:43 <eris>	i looked it up

Jul 05 12:35:16 <b4rkod_>	it was going to happen eventually
Jul 05 12:35:22 <No56>	collective reaction to this film in one image
Jul 05 12:35:29 <vitnira>	"M*A*S*H was "perfect for the times, the cacophony of American culture was brilliantly reproduced onscreen"
Jul 05 12:35:37 <vitnira>	i guess we don't like ameria then
Jul 05 12:35:41 <eris>	please return to the movie night channel
Jul 05 12:35:47 <Punp>	and nothing of value was lost
Jul 05 12:35:54 <eris>	you now will get an episode of childrens hospital, then beyond belief
Jul 05 12:36:05 <vitnira>	damn i can't believe it was that bad
Jul 05 12:36:08 <vitnira>	it's a hit tv show
Jul 05 12:36:26 <No56>	vitnira i really think its a boomer thing
Jul 05 12:36:27 <eris>	i'm guessing the tv show was way less egregious
Jul 05 12:36:34 <Punp>	Maybe, I hope so
Jul 05 12:36:40 <b4rkod_>	vit it is rape joke, homophobic joke, racist jokes back to back
Jul 05 12:37:00 <b4rkod_>	i don't remember a single like

Jul 05 12:37:58 <Punp>	Lilly they weren't even jokes
Jul 05 12:38:22 <b4rkod_>	if you were a lead poisoned boomer you would find rape and homophobia funny

Jul 05 12:56:09 <eris>	i scrambled all my creds on agora and logged out for the last time earlier this week
Jul 05 12:56:27 <No56>	the name is a combination of the names of the two horses that it was bred from

Jul 05 12:58:53 <eris>	oh shit, jewel staite
Jul 05 12:58:53 <Punp>	It's all actually made up, they could get away with it in the early days of the internet
Jul 05 12:58:56 <eris>	an actual actress
Jul 05 12:59:00 <eris>	in a beyond belief thing
Jul 05 12:59:00 <No56>	hey its the lady from firefly
Jul 05 12:59:02 <Punp>	I don't know who that is but she's hot

Jul 05 13:00:00 <No56>	ahaha is she going to play both twins
Jul 05 13:00:46 <Punp>	omg yessssw
Jul 05 13:00:50 <dug>	cheaper to hire one real actor than two twin actors
Jul 05 13:00:54 <Punp>	Now there are two of them.starwars
Jul 05 13:01:07 <b4rkod_>	how are they gonna do this shit
Jul 05 13:01:26 <Punp>	They just sort of bump them together
Jul 05 13:01:27 <b4rkod_>	she is a single person but i see 2 person on screen, marvelaus
Jul 05 13:01:30 <Punp>	oh, you mean the acting
Jul 05 13:01:32 <Punp>	body doubles
Jul 05 13:01:53 <Punp>	omg she's hugging herself wtffff
Jul 05 13:01:59 <Punp>	This really is beyond belief fact or fiction
Jul 05 13:02:07 <eris>	it must be so weird like actually being a twin
Jul 05 13:03:02 <Punp>	Yeah, how do you know which one you are?
Jul 05 13:03:21 <eris>	it'd just be so weird just seeing the person in the mirror also out in the world and pursuing their own agenda
Jul 05 13:03:24 <b4rkod_>	stupid deer
Jul 05 13:03:55 <Punp>	lmao the weird thing is she wasn't LISTENING to the CD
Jul 05 13:03:56 <No56>	irl twins rarely look exactly alike, they've got different body language too
Jul 05 13:04:05 <Punp>	It wasn't ACTUALLY her psychic connection!
Jul 05 13:04:12 <eris>	yeah the THING in the mirror doesn't look like me either
Jul 05 13:04:13 <No56>	i've had friends who were identical twins and my mom's an identical twin too
Jul 05 13:04:14 <eris>	it's backwards
Jul 05 13:04:28 <b4rkod_>	i know twins and after a year LIVING with them, i still forgot which one was which
Jul 05 13:04:29 <Punp>	What if you're the backwards one eris
Jul 05 13:04:32 <Punp>	This is FAKT
Jul 05 13:04:36 <eris>	backwards relevant to me
Jul 05 13:04:36 <No56>	im saying this one was true but they probably exaggerated it a lot
Jul 05 13:04:39 <eris>	i reckon this one is true
Jul 05 13:05:11 <vitnira>	is beyond belief a good show
Jul 05 13:05:14 <eris>	ah, this guy is autistic then
