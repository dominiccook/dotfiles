Jul 03 14:34:11 -InfoServ-	If you want a VHost, just use HostServ. For instructions, use the command /HELPOP GETVHOST (if that doesn't work, try /QUOTE HELPOP GETVHOST or /RAW HELPOP GETVHOST). Please make sure you only request a domain you own or is otherwise invalid.

Jul 03 14:34:11 -InfoServ-	If you need help from network administration for whatever reason, see /HELPOP HELPINFO for information on ways to get help. If this command doesn't work, try /QUOTE HELPOP HELPINFO or /RAW HELPOP HELPINFO. If none of those work, you can check for available operators with /stats P, or use HelpServ (/msg HelpServ help).
